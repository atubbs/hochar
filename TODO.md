# TODO 
* get rid of the provided db and populate with some dummy data instead
* make 'pinned ingredients' header show up only when needed ... or at all
* all sorts of error handling - bad input, requests fail, service not availble, etc.
* edit page should 404 on no ID found; not empty form ... or redirect to something else
* error handling on PUT/POST/DELETE operations (query/get to as long as we're at it)
* search ingredient-wise
* any sort of testing at all (unit, phantom, whatever)
