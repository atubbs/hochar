			this demo, no data is stored in the database.

					<ul>
						<li>As you click on one of the links in side navigation, the
							data is retrieved from server using RESTful API with the help of
							ngResource service, $resource (query action method)</li>
						<li>In New User Link, as you submit the new user, the data is
							sent to server using ngResource service, $resource (save action
							method)</li>
						<li>In All Users page, there is a link under each users name
							which takes you to user's details page. Again, this is retrieved
							using RESTful API, ngResource $resource service (get method)</li>
						<li>ng-view directive is used to access different views</li>
						<li>ngRoute module is used to load different views. Each view
							has got its templateURL and a controller.</li>
